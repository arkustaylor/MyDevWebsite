Final Fantasy VII is a 1997 role-playing video game developed by Square for the PlayStation console.

It is the seventh installment in the Final Fantasy series.

Published in Japan by Square, it was released in other regions by Sony Computer Entertainment and became the first in the main series to see a PAL release.

The game's story follows Cloud Strife, a mercenary who joins an eco-terrorist organization to stop a world-controlling megacorporation from using the planet's life essence as an energy source.

Events send Cloud and his allies in pursuit of Sephiroth, a superhuman who seeks to wound the planet.

During the journey, Cloud builds close friendships with his party members, including Aerith Gainsborough, who holds the secret to saving their world.

Development began in 1994, originally for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. 

After delays and technical difficulties from experimenting on several platforms, Square moved production to the PlayStation, largely due to the advantages of the CD-ROM format. 

Veteran Final Fantasy staff returned, including series creator and producer Hironobu Sakaguchi, director Yoshinori Kitase and composer Nobuo Uematsu.

The title became the first in the series to use full motion video and 3D computer graphics, which featured 3D character models superimposed over 2D pre-rendered backgrounds.

Final Fantasy VII introduced more widespread science fiction elements and a more realistic presentation, while the gameplay systems remained largely similar to previous entries, with the addition of new elements such as Materia, Limit Breaks and new minigames.

The game had a staff of over 100, with a combined development and marketing budget of around $80 million.

Assisted by a large promotional campaign, Final Fantasy VII received widespread commercial and critical success.

It remains widely regarded as a landmark title, and as one of the most influential and greatest video games of all time. 

The title won numerous Game of the Year awards, and was acknowledged for boosting sales of the PlayStation and popularizing console role-playing games worldwide.

Critics praised its graphics, gameplay, music, and story, although some criticism was directed towards its original English localization.

Its success has led to enhanced ports on various platforms, a multimedia sub-series called the Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, and the ongoing multipart high-definition Final Fantasy VII Remake where the first installment was released in 2020.
